# News Reader
> News Reader app uses newsapi.org API to get news. News is categorised in different categories.

#### Note: To run the app you have to add [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/register) key. I have taken this step to due to limited access to daily request for News. Getting a key would take just few seconds :)
